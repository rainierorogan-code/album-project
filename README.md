# Database Migration

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

---

# Create Superuser

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

---

# Run Development Server

```bash

```

---

# Cloudinary Configuration

Install Cloudinary packages:

```bash
pip install cloudinary django-cloudinary-storage
```

Add the following to `settings.py`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    ...
    'cloudinary',
    'cloudinary_storage',
]

DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
```

---

# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The application implements RBAC using Django Groups and Permissions.

## Standard User

Can:
- View albums
- Upload photos
- Edit own content

Cannot:
- Manage other users
- Delete system-wide content

---

## Album Administrator

Can:
- Manage all albums
- Delete any photo
- Manage users and permissions

---

# Class-Based Views Used

The system utilizes Django CBVs such as:

- ListView
- DetailView
- CreateView
- UpdateView
- DeleteView
- LoginView
- LogoutView

Example:

```python
from django.views.generic import ListView
from .models import Album

class AlbumListView(ListView):
    model = Album
    template_name = 'albums/album_list.html'
```

---

# Deployment on Render

## Deployment Steps

1. Push project to GitHub
2. Create PostgreSQL database on Render
3. Create a new Web Service on Render
4. Connect the GitHub repository
5. Add environment variables
6. Deploy application

---

# Build Command

```bash
./build.sh
```

---

# Start Command

```bash
gunicorn core.wsgi:application
```

---

# Production Security Notes

- DEBUG disabled in production
- Secret keys stored in environment variables
- Cloudinary used instead of local media storage
- PostgreSQL used for scalable production database management
